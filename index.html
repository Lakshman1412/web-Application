                <p> Hi, I'm Lakshman Mylipilli, My background includes a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science And Enginerring from
                    Prathyusha Engineering College. I'M A STUDENT WHO IS ENTHUSIAST IN BUILDING NEW THINGS IN AN 
                    INNOVATIVE WAY WITH DRIVEN SECURITY AND A PASSIONATE COLLEGE STUDENT WHO WANTS TO WORK IN

                <p> I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology and
                    management here at the Illinois institute of technology. It's a pleasure to address you all today
                    and give you a glimpse into my journey and what lies ahead.

                    Looking beyond my degree, I have clear intentions for my future. My goal is to develop code and 
                    building software services. This will allow me to develop end-to-end solutions independently and
                     contribute effectively to full-stack development projects.

                <p>Before embarking on this academic journey, I had done my intership in java language. I had done my Internship at shaiash solutions private Limited.

                    One of my hobbies that I'm deeply passionate about is playing Cricket. Engaging in this sport
                    brings me immense joy and allows me to unwind and recharge.</p>
